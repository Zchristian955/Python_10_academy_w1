# Telecommunication analysis for TellCo
The investor is interested in purchasing TellCo, an existing mobile service provider in the Republic of Pefkakia.  TellCoâ€™s current owners have been willing to share their financial information but have never employed anyone to look at their data that is generated automatically by their systems. The employer wants you to provide a report to analyze opportunities for growth and make a recommendation on whether TellCo is worth buying or selling.  We do this by analyzing a telecommunication dataset that contains useful information about the customers & their activities on the network. We will deliver insights we managed to extract to the employer through an easy to use web based dashboard and a written report.
